  <h2>My Role</h2>
  <p>I worked on the Design Team under Product Development to rebuild the
    front-end architecture, CSS grid system and design language for Chirp.</p>
</div>
<div class="portfolio-description">
  <h2>Task Manager</h2>
  <p>During my time with Iora, we built and defined the design language for
    Chirp, and once it was finished, it was time to stress-test our pattern
    library. Pushing it to the limits to see where our designs would start to
    break down. Each member of the design team was in charge of redesigning a
    section of the Chirp platform; I was in charge of redesigning the Task
    Manager as well as running a spike to see how long it would take to redevelop
    the front-end architecture.</p>

  <h2>UX Research:<br>User Interviews, Profiles & Usability Testing</h2>
  <p>During the redesign of Chirp, the design team would meet with various
    individuals ranging from health coaches to doctors, conducting user interviews
    and facilitating usability testing with lo-fi prototypes. Iora encouraged
    all members of the product team to visit Iora care team members to build an
    understanding of people's needs when using Chirp.</p>
  <p>Below are two of Chirp's user personas:</p>

        <p>Primary User<br>
          Jane Foster<br>
          Role: Health Coach</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="profile__bio">
      <p>Characteristics</p>
      <p>Jane is a health coach on the care team, bridging the gap between the
        patients, nurses, and doctors.</p>
      <p>Jane loves to connect deeply with her patients, encouraging them and
        cheering them on to get to a better state of health. Jane is often very
        busy managing so many patients for the care teams at the Iora Health
        facility that, as a mental break, she will stop to water the plants
        around the office.</p>
      <p>Primary Goal:</p>
      <p>Easily manage daily tasks requested by various members of her care team.</p>

    <div class="profile__bio">
      <p>Characteristics</p>
      <p>Albert is always in the fast lane, moving from patient to patient,
        but attentive to each one's needs.</p>
      <p>Albert loves working with such a passionately driven team, but finding
        time to communicate one-on-one with the team can be tough. Getting a
        birdâ€™s eye view of what his team is doing day-to-day would make his
        life a little easier.</p>
      <p>Primary Goal</p>
      <p>View tasks needed for patients and assign to various members of the care team.</p>

  <h2>Lo-fi Prototypes; Testing with Invision</h2>
  <p>The design team liked to move quickly and care team members were always
    ready to volunteer their services just to get a glimpse of the redesign.
    Instead of waiting hours for the engineering team to building out a design,
    the design team would put together lo-fi prototypes using Invision. This
    usability testing process boosted team morale, allowing care team members
    the opportunity to voice their opinions on the platform.</p>
