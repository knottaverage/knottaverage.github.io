            <h2>A logo built with love.</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="post-container__content">
            <p>I remember once when Jim from Ace Ticket pulled me into his office. We started talking about Ace’s logo and he was interested in a redesign. As he started to get into the reasons why he wanted to do a redesign, I stopped him as soon as I could and said there was no reason for it. I truly felt that the natural evolution of Ace’s logo was a classic design that may just need some tweaking here and there, but there was no need for an overhaul. There was something special about that logo Jim had paid some “design guy” a couple of bucks to create for him, and I strongly believed that.</p>

<div class="post-image-container">
  <img src="/img/posts/20161108/ace-ticket-evolution.jpg" style="width: 100%" />
  <div class="subtext">The evolution of Ace's logo</div>
</div>

<p>After talking Jim down from the idea of a redesign, he asked me to create something for Ace’s charity, Ace Embrace. I ran through many ideas that week as to what this logo could be. Since most of the charities Jim had donated to at that point were geared towards children, I went down a rabbit hole of silhouettes and crayon typefaces, trying to create something that represented Ace and showed compassion for children.</p>

<p>Finally, the day came when I had to present the logos and I felt like all the ideas so far fell flat. There was nothing that I could be proud of and with little time left before the big meeting, the only thing I was sure of was that Jim probably wouldn’t like any of them either. Now, I can’t recall how long I stared at those logos, debating which one I was going to show Jim first, but I remember how I felt when the idea hit me. It was those arches in the Ace logo, that top curve in the ticket that always attracted my eye; it was love every time I looked at it. I started to wonder if I could somehow arrange into a heart. After only a few minutes of playing around, it all just came together. It was that ‘Ah-ha!’ moment, that feeling designers love when they feel they’ve nailed the solution of their design problems.</p>

<div class="post-image-container">
  <img src="/img/posts/20161108/heart-logo.jpg" />
  <div class="subtext">Love at first sight.</div>
</div>

<p>The heart had it all. It gleamed with Ace’s personality and showed the caring side that Jim had for so many charities that people don’t often get to see. After some additional changes in color, it now came time to find a typeface for Ace Embrace. With past iterations using a more clownish typeface and knowing that in the sports industry slab typefaces are often the norm, I wanted Ace Embrace to have a more sophisticated look, something that emoted an angelic feeling when looked at.</p>

<p>It was the concave curve in Calson’s A that once again had me in love. When I brought the two together, the way the curve of the ticket rolled into the curves of the heart, I felt no need to go further with testing other typefaces.</p>

<div class="post-image-container">
  <img src="/img/posts/20161108/A.jpg" />
  <div class="subtext">That curve, ooh-lala.</div>
</div>

<p>To me, the project finally felt whole and I was satisfied in creating a solid logo to present to Jim. So I once again gathered all my mocks, but this time I was able to hold my head up high knowing that when we discussed the future of the Ace Embrace logo, we now had a solid option to go with.</p>
